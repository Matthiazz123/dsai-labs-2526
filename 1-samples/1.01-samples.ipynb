    "## Basic Concepts in Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables and Measurement Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics and data science, a 💡**variable** is any attribute of an object of study. Variables can have 💡**values** that differ between objects. Usually, variables are classified into different types, or 💡**measurement levels**, depending on the kind of values they can take and the mathematical operations that can be performed on them. The most common types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 💡**Qualitative** (or categorical) variables: variables that can take on a limited number of distinct categories or labels. These are not necessarily numerical.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 💡**Nominal** variables: categorical variables *without a specific order* or ranking among the categories (e.g., colors, types of animals).\n",
    "    - 💡**Ordinal** variables: categorical variables *with a specific order* or ranking among the categories (e.g., education level, customer satisfaction ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "- 💡**Quantitative** (or numerical) variables: variables that can take on numerical values, which can be discrete (countable values) or continuous (any value within a range). These are usually the result of measurements. Often, there are many different values of quantitative variables in a dataset, or they may even be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - 💡**Interval** variables: numerical variables where the intervals between values are meaningful, but there is no true zero point (e.g., temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit).\n",
    "    - 💡**Ratio** variables: numerical variables with a true zero point, allowing for meaningful ratios between values (e.g., height, weight, age).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to correctly identify the type of variable you are working with, as this influences the choice of statistical methods and visualizations used for analysis. This is something that a computer is not very good at, so you often need to make these distinctions yourself when exploring and analyzing a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Populations, samples, observations\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science and statistics, a 💡**population** refers to the entire set of individuals or items that you are interested in studying. A 💡**sample** is a subset of the population that is selected for analysis. A single individual or item within a population or sample is called an 💡**observation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of sampling is to gather information about the population without having to study every individual or item within it. Under certain conditions (which will be explored later in this course), you can use the information obtained from a sample to make inferences about the entire population. This is often necessary because studying the entire population can be impractical, time-consuming, or expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "When selecting a sample from a population, it is important to ensure that the sample has specific characteristics. Specifically, a sample should be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 💡**Randomly selected**, i.e. every individual or item in the population should have an *equal chance of being included* in the sample in order to reduce bias, but randomness alone does not guarantee that a sample is perfectly representative - especially for small sample sizes..\n",
    "- **Large enough** to provide reliable estimates of population parameters. We will explore this more in chapter 3.\n",
    "- 💡**Representative** of the population, meaning that it should accurately reflect the characteristics of the population as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, a researcher would do the following to draw a sample from a population:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First and foremost, the population must be well defined\n",
    "- Then you can compile a 💡**sampling frame**, i.e. a list of all individuals in the population\n",
    "- Then, the researcher randomly selects a number of individuals from this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often difficult or impossible to set up a sampling frame. In such cases, the researcher chooses a different sampling method and tries to approximate the properties listed above as closely as possible within the available time and budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling errors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Even under the best of circumstances, the result within a sample is likely to deviate from the \"true\" value in the population, although we hope we can approach it sufficiently. So by taking a sample we inevitably introduce errors. A useful way to categorize errors is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 💡**Sampling errors** are caused by the way we take a sample. We distinguish between 💡*random* or 💡*systematic* sampling errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Random sampling errors** are only due to chance and cannot be avoided. Every time you take a random sample, you will get a different result within that sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Systematic sampling errors** are worse, because they can cause the results to be biased and therefore no longer be *representative* of a population. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Online survey: people without internet are excluded\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Street survey: only people who are currently walking there\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Voluntary survey: only interested parties participate\n",
    "\n",
    "- 💡**Non-sampling errors** are errors that occur after the sample has been taken, e.g. in the measurement and analysis. In this case, we speak of non-sampling errors and again we distinguish between *random* and *systematic*:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Random non-sampling errors** For example, a respondent accidentally selects or fills out a wrong answer in a survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Systematic non-sampling errors** For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - a measuring device that is not calibrated correctly and systematically gives a slightly higher value than the true value. \n",
    "\n",
    "        - respondents intentionally underestimate or overestimate reality (e.g. when asked about how much you smoke or drink alcohol on a daily basis)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representative samples\n",
    "\n",
    "A sample is said to be 💡**representative** of a population when the characteristics of the sample closely match those of the population. This means that the sample accurately reflects the diversity and distribution of key variables within the population, allowing for valid inferences to be made about the entire population based on the sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 💡**stratified** sample, the population is divided into subgroups (or strata) based on certain characteristics, and samples are drawn from each stratum in proportion to their representation in the population. This helps ensure that the sample is representative of the population as a whole, especially when certain subgroups may be underrepresented in a simple random sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a population of 5810 individuals consists of the following age groups and genders:\n",
    "\n",
    "|           | $\\le 18$ | $]18,25]$ | $]25, 40]$ | $> 40$ | Total |\n",
    "| --------: | -------: | --------: | ---------: | -----: | ----: |\n",
    "|     Woman |      500 |      1500 |       1000 |    250 |  3250 |\n",
    "|       Man |      400 |      1200 |        800 |    160 |  2560 |\n",
    "| **Total** |      900 |      2700 |       1800 |    410 |  5810 |\n",
    "\n",
    "A stratified sample of 10% would then consist of 581 individuals, with the following distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "|           | $\\le 18$ | $]18,25]$ | $]25, 40]$ | $> 40$ | Total |\n",
    "| --------: | -------: | --------: | ---------: | -----: | ----: |\n",
    "|     Woman |       50 |       150 |        100 |     25 |   325 |\n",
    "|       Man |       40 |       120 |         80 |     16 |   256 |\n",
    "| **Total** |       90 |       270 |        180 |     41 |   581 |\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter 4, we will discuss a method that allows us to verify whether a sample is representative of a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Univariate vs multivariate analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter 2, on 💡**univariate analysis**, we will focus on analyzing and summarizing data for a single variable at a time. This involves techniques such as calculating measures of central tendency (*mean*, *median*, *mode*) and measures of dispersion (*range*, *variance*, *standard deviation*), as well as creating visualizations like histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapters 4 to 6, we will explore various methods to investigate whether two variables have some kind of relationship or association with each other, under the umbrella term of 💡**bivariate analysis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The appopriate analysis or visualization technique always depends on the measurement levels of the variables involved. For example, we might use a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two quantitative variables, or a contingency table to examine the association between two categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that two variables have an 💡**association** or a 💡**relationship** when the value of one variable provides some information about the value of the other variable. For example, there may be an association between age and income, where older individuals tend to have higher incomes. The variable that provides information about the other variable is called the 💡**independent variable**, while the variable being predicted or explained is called the 💡**dependent variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to understand that when you find an association between two variables, it does not necessarily imply a causal relationship. A phrase often used in this context is **correlation is not causation**. In other words, just because two variables are associated does not mean that one variable causes the other to change. There may be other factors at play, or the association could be entirely coincidental (*spurious correlation*). See some examples [here](https://plotlygraphs.medium.com/spurious-correlations-56752fcffb69) and [here](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)."
